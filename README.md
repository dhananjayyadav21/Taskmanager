## System Architecture üåê


+--------------------+         +----------------------+
|    User Interface  |         |     REST API         |
| (React.js Frontend) |         |  (Node.js & Express) |
+--------------------+         +----------------------+
           |                               |
           |          HTTP Requests        |
           v                               v
+---------------------------------------------------+
|                  MongoDB Database                 |
|   (Stores tasks, user information, and metadata)  |
+---------------------------------------------------+


Frontend (React.js): The user interacts with the application through a responsive and dynamic interface. User actions (e.g., creating, updating, or deleting tasks) trigger API calls.

Backend (Node.js & Express): REST APIs handle incoming HTTP requests, process data, and interact with the database.

Database (MongoDB): Stores user details, task data, and application metadata securely and efficiently.
