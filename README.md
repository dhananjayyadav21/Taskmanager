Frontend (React.js): The user interacts with the application through a responsive and dynamic interface. User actions (e.g., creating, updating, or deleting tasks) trigger API calls.

Backend (Node.js & Express): REST APIs handle incoming HTTP requests, process data, and interact with the database.

Database (MongoDB): Stores user details, task data, and application metadata securely and efficiently.
